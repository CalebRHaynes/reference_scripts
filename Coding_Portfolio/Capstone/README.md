- **leadScoring_featurePrep.py**: Loads lead/opportunity data, cleans and merges it, creates product group counts and date-based features, and one-hot encodes categorical variables for modeling.  
- **test_models.py**: Loads prepared features, runs 5-fold stratified CV with Random Forest and LightGBM classifiers, and evaluates their ROC AUC scores.  

*From a Summer 2025 Columbia University SPS Applied Analytics Master's Program capstone project (lead scoring). Intended as an example and reference only.*
